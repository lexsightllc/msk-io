# Offline Multimodal Diagnostic Pipeline

This canonical whitepaper standardizes module naming across the symbolic offline diagnostic system. Components such as `SymbolicStateEmitter`, `SymbioticAffinityGraph`, and `RecursiveInvarianceMonitor` are capitalized and presented in monospace for clarity and interoperability.

## Pipeline Overview

1. `DICOMLoader` ingests imaging studies, forwarding them to `Dicom2Nifti` or `SimpleITK` for conversion.
2. Converted images are transformed into PNG format for downstream processing.
3. `OCREngine` extracts embedded text while `PDFTextExtractor` gathers associated reports.
4. `TotalSegmentator` produces `SegmentationMasks` that flow into the `ConstraintMapper`.
5. Results from `BiomedicalNLP` and `NERParser` merge with segmentation outputs in the `SymbolicStateEmitter`, forming edges in the `SymbioticAffinityGraph`.
6. Inference proceeds over a `ConstraintLattice`, applying `WildCoreSecurity` before invoking `Phi-2` or `Gemma-2B` for final reasoning.
7. `RecursiveInvarianceMonitor` verifies state stability and `AuditLogger` records `StateVector` metrics prior to `HumanInTheLoop` review.

## Temporal Inference Cycle

At each iteration, the symbolic state vector updates according to
$$
v_{t+1} = f(v_t, c_t),
$$
where $c_t$ represents the constraints applied at step $t$. Convergence occurs when
$$
\|v_{t+1} - v_t\| < \epsilon \quad \text{or} \quad \Delta H < \gamma,
$$
with $\epsilon$ defining a norm threshold and $\gamma$ an entropy delta bound.

## Constraint Lattice

The lattice governing symbolic transitions is defined as
$$
\mathcal{L} = \langle \mathcal{N}, \preceq, \mathcal{C} \rangle,
$$
where $\mathcal{N}$ represents node predicates (diagnostic facts), $\preceq$ encodes logical dependency, and $\mathcal{C}$ maps transitions to boolean validity.

## Policy Arbitration

The `MultiAgentHarmonizer` selects agent output using a trust-weighted softmax:
$$
y = \arg\max_i \left( w_i \cdot S_i \right),
$$
where $w_i$ denotes each agent's trust score and $S_i$ its symbolic coherence.

## Memory and Audit Hashing

Each symbolic state $S_n$ is hashed to create a verifiable chain:
$$
H_n = \text{SHA256}(S_n || H_{n-1}),
$$
providing tamper-proof longitudinal logs across inference steps.

## BioCLIP Consistency

Text and image embeddings must satisfy
$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{v_t \cdot v_i}{\|v_t\|\,\|v_i\|},
$$
where $v_t$ denotes the textual embedding and $v_i$ the image embedding. Thresholds ensure clinically reliable cross-modal pairing.

## Automated DICOM-to-Report Pipeline

From ingestion to diagnostic inference, the system runs entirely offline and without mandatory visualization. Collaborative agents built from MiniGPT, GEMA and Phi-2 orchestrate each stage:

1. **Ingestion** – `pydicom` and `nibabel` load volumetric data, applying window width and level constants from `bConstants`. Volumes are resampled and reoriented with SimpleITK or ITK, and missing metadata is inferred from pixel distributions and slice patterns.
2. **Normalization** – Voxel intensities are percentile clipped and histogram matched using `scikit-image`. Anisotropic diffusion or Gaussian kernels handle noise removal. Snapshots and segmentations synchronize with the evolving Diagnostic Entity Framework (DEF) for direct matching to prior definitions.
3. **Segmentation** – Domain-adapted pipelines powered by `nnUNet`, `TotalSegmentator` and MONAI create masks under DEF-driven thresholds. Post-processing via `scipy.ndimage` and OpenCV removes artifacts and yields morphologic metrics such as volume or surface ratios. Each resulting mask becomes a `DiagnosticEntity` dataclass instance for downstream relation mapping.
4. **Temporal Reasoning** – Agents generate synthetic axial, coronal and sagittal views and classify sequences both temporally and anatomically. Contrastive embeddings compare left and right sides or prior exams, refining text inferences extracted from OCR or PDF metadata.
5. **Harmonization** – The `MultiAgentHarmonizer` fuses `AgentOutput` objects using weighted consensus or Bayesian rules. When confidence is low, resegmentation triggers using original DICOM data cached in `MemoryVault`.
6. **Standardization and Reporting** – Final DEFs map to RadLex and SNOMED before BioGPT or ClinicalBERT generates structured HL7 or DICOM-SR reports. DEFs serialize into JSON-LD for persistent embedding within FAISS or Annoy vector stores.
7. **Traceability** – LETS telemetry logs every derivation so agents can audit disagreements or synthesize new DEF templates autonomously.

This pipeline is extensible to new modalities or external APIs while maintaining self-contained diagnostic inference.
## Conclusion

By architecting a fully symbolic-constrained, offline multimodal diagnostic system, this pipeline not only meets clinical compliance standards but sets a precedent for sovereign, privacy-preserving AI in medicine. It is infrastructure-ready for edge deployment across air-gapped institutions, battlefield medicine, and rural diagnostics without sacrificing inference rigor or explainability.
