# Prototype Applications

This folder collects experimental clients that integrate with the MSK-IO APIs:

- `browser-extension/` – captures OHIF frames in Chromium-based browsers.
- `flutter-app/` – mobile prototype for clinician review.
- `pwa/` – progressive web app proof of concept.

Each subproject maintains its own tooling; they are excluded from the Python lint/type workflows but should follow framework best practices.
